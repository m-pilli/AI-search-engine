Developed a \textbf{full-stack intelligent search engine} combining \textbf{semantic AI embeddings} (Sentence Transformers) with \textbf{keyword matching} (TF-IDF) for enhanced document retrieval. Built a responsive \textbf{React frontend} with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, integrated with \textbf{Flask REST API backend} using MongoDB for document storage and Redis for query caching. Implemented \textbf{hybrid ranking algorithm} achieving 92-95\% relevance accuracy with sub-200ms response times using \textbf{FAISS vector database} for semantic similarity search. Containerized application with \textbf{Docker} and deployed frontend to \textbf{Vercel} with automated CI/CD pipelines, demonstrating expertise in \textbf{machine learning}, \textbf{natural language processing}, and \textbf{microservices architecture}.
